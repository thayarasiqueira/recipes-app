# Recipes app

This group project brings a recipe app capable of viewing, searching, filtering, favoriting and tracking the progress of food and drink preparation.

The APIs used are the following:
- TheMealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/)
- CockTailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

The layout is focused on mobile devices, so all prototypes were developed for smaller screens.

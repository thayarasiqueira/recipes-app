This group project brings a recipe app capable of viewing, searching, filtering, favoriting and tracking the progress of food and drink preparation.

The APIs used are the following:
- TheMealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/)
- CockTailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)

The layout is focused on mobile devices, so all prototypes were developed for smaller screens.

The group organized itself through the Kanban method, using Trello to allow all team members visualizing and changing each state of each demmand.
